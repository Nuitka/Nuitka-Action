An example would be "--include-data-dir=/path/some_dir=data/some_dir" for plain copy, of the whole directory. All files are copied, if you want to exclude files you need to remove them beforehand, or use "--noinclude-data-files" option to remove them. Default empty.'
  include-data-files:
    description: 'Include data files by filenames in the distribution. There are many allowed forms. With "--include-data-files=/path/to/file/*.txt=folder_name/some.txt" it will copy a single file and complain if it"s multiple. With "--include-data-files=/path/to/files/*.txt=folder_name/" it will put all matching files into that folder.

To avoid unwanted sub packages, e.g. tests you can e.g. do this "--nofollow-import-to=*.tests". Default empty.'
  include-module:
    description: 'Include a single module. Give as a Python namespace, e.g. "some_package.some_module" and Nuitka will then find it and include it in the binary or extension module it creates, and make it available for import by the code. Default empty.'

If not desired, there is --no- prefer-source-code to disable warnings about it. Default off."

  # Onefile behaviour details
  onefile-tempdir-spec:
    description: "Use this as a folder to unpack onefile. Defaults to '%TEMP%\\onefile_%PID%_%TIME%', but e.g. '%CACHE_DIR%/%COMPANY%/%PRODUCT%/%VERSION%' would be cached and good too."
