  ### Nuitka Modes ###
  mode:
    description: |
      Mode in which to compile. Accelerated runs in your Python
      installation and depends on it. Standalone creates a folder
      with an executable contained to run it. Onefile creates a
      single executable to deploy. App is onefile except on macOS
      where it's not to be used. Default is 'accelerated'.
    default: app
  python-flag:
    description: |
      Python flags to use. Default is what you are using to run Nuitka, this
      enforces a specific mode. These are options that also exist to standard
      Python executable. Currently supported: "-S" (alias "no_site"),
      "static_hashes" (do not use hash randomization), "no_warnings" (do not
      give Python run time warnings), "-O" (alias "no_asserts"), "no_docstrings"
      (do not use doc strings), "-u" (alias "unbuffered"), "isolated" (do not
      load outside code) and "-m" (package mode, compile as "package.__main__").
      Default empty.
  python-debug:
    description: |
      Use debug version or not. Default uses what you are using to run Nuitka, most
      likely a non-debug version. Only for debugging and testing purposes.

  ### Nuitka Plugins to enable. ###
  enable-plugins:
    description: |
      Enabled plugins. Must be plug-in names. Use '--plugin-list' to query the
      full list and exit. Default empty.
  user-plugin:
    description: |
      The file name of user plugin. Can be given multiple times. Default empty.
  plugin-no-detection:
    description: |
      Plugins can detect if they might be used, and the you can disable the warning
      via "--disable-plugin=plugin-that-warned", or you can use this option to disable
      the mechanism entirely, which also speeds up compilation slightly of course as
      this detection code is run in vain once you are certain of which plugins to
      use. Defaults to off.
  module-parameter:
    description: |
      Provide a module parameter. You are asked by some packages
      to provide extra decisions. Format is currently
      --module-parameter=module.name-option-name=value
      Default empty.

  ### Include Qt Plugins. ###
  include-qt-plugins:
    description: "A comma separated list of Qt plugins, such as qml, etc."
  noinclude-qt-plugins:
    description: "A comma separated list of Qt plugins to not included, to take away from default."

  ### Nuitka Tracing/Reporting features
  report:
    description: |
      Report module, data files, compilation, plugin, etc. details in an XML output file. This
      is also super useful for issue reporting. These reports can e.g. be used to re-create
      the environment easily using it with '--create-environment-from-report', but contain a
      lot of information. Default is off.
  report-diffable:
    description: |
      Report data in diffable form, i.e. no timing or memory usage values that vary from run
      to run. Default is off.
  report-user-provided:
    description: |
      Report data from you. This can be given multiple times and be
      anything in 'key=value' form, where key should be an identifier, e.g. use
      '--report-user-provided=pipenv-lock-hash=64a5e4' to track some input values.
      Default is empty.
  report-template:
    description: |
      Report via template. Provide template and output filename 'template.rst.j2:output.rst'. For
      built-in templates, check the User Manual for what these are. Can be given multiple times.
      Default is empty.
  quiet:
    description: |
      Disable all information outputs, but show warnings.
      Defaults to off.
  show-scons:
    description: |
      Run the C building backend Scons with verbose information, showing the executed commands,
      detected compilers. Defaults to off.
  show-memory:
    description: |
      Provide memory information and statistics.
      Defaults to off.

  ### Control the inclusion of data files in result. ###
  include-package-data:
    description: |
      Include data files for the given package name. DLLs and extension modules
      are not data files and never included like this. Can use patterns the
      filenames as indicated below. Data files of packages are not included
      by default, but package configuration can do it.
      This will only include non-DLL, non-extension modules, i.e. actual data
      files. After a ":" optionally a filename pattern can be given as
      well, selecting only matching files. Examples:
      "--include-package-data=package_name" (all files)
      "--include-package-data=package_name:*.txt" (only certain type)
      "--include-package-data=package_name:some_filename.dat (concrete file)
      Default empty.
  include-data-files:
    description: |
      Include data files by filenames in the distribution. There are many
      allowed forms. With '--include-data-files=/path/to/file/*.txt=folder_name/some.txt' it
      will copy a single file and complain if it's multiple. With
      '--include-data-files=/path/to/files/*.txt=folder_name/' it will put
      all matching files into that folder. For recursive copy there is a
      form with 3 values that '--include-data-files=/path/to/scan=folder_name/=**/*.txt'
      that will preserve directory structure. Default empty.
  include-data-dir:
    description: |
      Include data files from complete directory in the distribution. This is
      recursive. Check '--include-data-files' with patterns if you want non-recursive
      inclusion. An example would be '--include-data-dir=/path/some_dir=data/some_dir'
      for plain copy, of the whole directory. All non-code files are copied, if you
      want to use '--noinclude-data-files' option to remove them. Default empty.
  noinclude-data-files:
    description: |
      Do not include data files matching the filename pattern given. This is against
      the target filename, not source paths. So to ignore a file pattern from package
      data for 'package_name' should be matched as 'package_name/*.txt'. Or for the
      whole directory simply use 'package_name'. Default empty.
  include-onefile-external-data:
    description: |
      Include the specified data file patterns outside of the onefile binary,
      rather than on the inside. Makes only sense in case of '--onefile'
      compilation. First files have to be specified as included with other
      `--include-*data*` options, and then this refers to target paths
      inside the distribution. Default empty.
  include-raw-dir:
    description: |
      Include raw directories completely in the distribution. This is
      recursive. Check '--include-data-dir' to use the sane option.
      Default empty.

  ### Control the inclusion of modules and packages in result. ###
  include-package:
    description: 'Include a whole package. Give as a Python namespace, e.g. "some_package.sub_package" and Nuitka will then find it and include it and all the modules found below that disk location in the binary or extension module it creates, and make it available for import by the code. To avoid unwanted sub packages, e.g. tests you can e.g. do this "--nofollow-import-to=*.tests". Default empty.'
  include-module:
    description: 'Include a single module. Give as a Python namespace, e.g. "some_package.some_module" and Nuitka will then find it and include it in the binary or extension module it creates, and make it available for import by the code. Default empty.'
  include-plugin-directory:
    description: "Include the content of that directory, no matter if it is used by the given main program in a visible form. Overrides all other inclusion options. Can be given multiple times. Default empty."
  include-plugin-files:
    description: "Include into files matching the PATTERN. Overrides all other follow options. Can be given multiple times. Default empty."
  prefer-source-code:
    description: "For already compiled extension modules, where there is both a source file and an extension module, normally the extension module is used, but it should be better to compile the module from available source code for best performance. If not desired, there is --no- prefer-source-code to disable warnings about it. Default off."
  nofollow-import-to:
    description: "Do not follow to that module name even if used, or if a package name, to the whole package in any case, overrides all other options. Can be given multiple times. Default empty."
  user-package-configuration-file:
    description: "User provided YAML file with package configuration. You can include DLLs, remove bloat, add hidden dependencies. Check User Manual for a complete description of the format to use. Can be given multiple times. Defaults to empty."

  ### Onefile behavior details ###
  onefile-tempdir-spec:
    description: "Use this as a folder to unpack onefile. Defaults to '%TEMP%\\onefile_%PID%_%TIME%', but e.g. '%CACHE_DIR%/%COMPANY%/%PRODUCT%/%VERSION%' would be cached and good too."
  onefile-child-grace-time:
    description: "When stopping the child, e.g. due to CTRL-C or shutdown, how much time to allow before killing it the hard way. Unit is ms. Default 5000."
  onefile-no-compression:
    description: "When creating the onefile, disable compression of the payload. Default is false."

    description: |
      Enable warnings for implicit exceptions detected at compile time.

    description: |
      Enable warnings for unusual code detected at compile time.
  assume-yes-for-downloads:
    description: |
      Allow Nuitka to download external code if necessary, e.g. dependency
      walker, ccache, and even gcc on Windows. To disable, redirect input
      from nul device, e.g. "</dev/null" or "<NUL:". Default is to prompt.
    default: true
  nowarn-mnemonic:
    description: |
      Disable warning for a given mnemonic. These are given to make sure you are aware of
      certain topics, and typically point to the Nuitka website. The mnemonic is the part
      of the URL at the end, without the HTML suffix. Can be given multiple times and
      accepts shell pattern. Default empty.

  ### Deployment modes ###
  deployment:
    description: |
      Disable code aimed at making finding compatibility issues easier. This
      will e.g. prevent execution with "-c" argument, which is often used by
      code that attempts run a module, and causes a program to start itself
      over and over potentially. Disable once you deploy to end users, for
      finding typical issues, this is very helpful during development. Default
      off.
  no-deployment-flag:
    description: |
      Keep deployment mode, but disable selectively parts of it. Errors from
      deployment mode will output these identifiers. Default empty.

  ### Output choices ##
  output-dir:
    description: "Directory for output builds"
    default: build
  output-file:
    description: "Specify how the executable should be named. For extension modules there is no choice, also not for standalone mode and using it will be an error. This may include path information that needs to exist though. Defaults to '<program_name>' on this platform. .exe)"

  ### Console handling ###

    description: |
      Select console mode to use. Default mode is 'force' and creates a
      console window unless the program was started from one. With 'disable'
      it doesn't create or use a console at all. With 'attach' an existing
      console will be used for outputs. With 'hide' a newly spawned console
      will be hidden and an already existing console will behave like
      'force'. Default is 'force'.

      Mode of application for the application bundle. When launching a Window, and appearing
      in Docker is desired, default value "gui" is a good fit. Without a Window ever, the
      application is a "background" application. For UI elements that get to display later,
      "ui-element" is in-between. The application will not appear in dock, but get full
      access to desktop when it does open a Window later.
  macos-sign-identity:
    description: |
      When signing on macOS, by default an ad-hoc identify will be used, but with this
      option your get to specify another identity to use. The signing of code is now
      mandatory on macOS and cannot be disabled. Use "auto" to detect your only identity
      installed. Default "ad-hoc" if not given.
  macos-sign-notarization:
    description: |
      When signing for notarization, using a proper TeamID identity from Apple, use
      the required runtime signing option, such that it can be accepted.
